				<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<p>
					For many of us, it is easy to find both the objects in a picture and their boundaries. Humans are
					very good at identifying what something is and where it is given a clear line of sight, but what if
					we need to find the boundaries of many objects in an enormously large number photos? While we could
					put a room full of toddlers with markers at work and tell them to outline the edges in a stack of
					photos, we can do better in both performance and morals by making a computer do this task for us! In
					fact, in computer vision, this is a general problem known as <strong>edge detection</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Formally, edge detection is the process of detecting the boundaries in an image that separate great
					changes in brightness or <strong>intensity</strong>. One of the reasons to do edge detection is that
					it is able to reduce a complex image down to a simpler one where only these edges are marked.
					Because of this, edge detection often acts as a preliminary step to other computer vision processes.
				</p>

				<h2>Image Representation</h2>

				<p>
					Before jumping into edge detection, we still need to do a little work with images. Computers
					generally store images as grids of values or <strong>pixel arrays</strong>. A color image, for
					instance, is decomposable into three pixel arrays storing the RGB color channels. While RGB is
					convenient for representing color, edge detection is only interested in looking at intensity values.
					Fortunately for us, it is possible to directly compute intensity from RGB values, giving us a pixel
					array of grayscale intensities.

					<h4><strong>From RGB to Intensity</strong></h4>
					<p>
						The conversion from RGB to intensity is a somewhat involved process that delves into color
						science and human perception. While RGB is a helpful model, in reality, humans do not perceive
						color linearly or equally among the three channels. To convert RGB to intensity, each RGB value
						must first be mapped into a linear color space. These values are then put through a weighted sum
						and converted back to our non-linear RGB color space for display.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>
					We have introduced edge detection as the problem of finding the boundaries dividing sharp intensity
					changes in an image as well as understanding computer images as pixel arrays. In the next section,
					we will explore the underlying mechanism for detecting edges.
