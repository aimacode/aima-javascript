			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<br>

			<p>
				For many of us, it is easy to find both the objects in a picture and their boundaries. Humans are very
				good at identifying what something is and where it is given a clear line of sight, but what if we need
				to find the boundaries of many objects in an enormously large number photos? While we could put a room
				full of toddlers with markers at work and tell them to outline the edges in a stack of photos, we can do
				better in both performance and morals by making a computer do this task for us! In fact, in computer
				vision, this is a general problem known as <strong>edge detection</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Formally, edge detection is the process of detecting the boundaries in an image that separate great
				changes in brightness or <strong>intensity</strong>. One of the reasons to do edge detection is that it
				is able to reduce a complex image down to a simpler one where only these edges are marked. Because of
				this, edge detection often acts as a preliminary step to other computer vision processes.

			<p>
				Before coming up with an algorithm for edge detection, we must first understand what kind of data it
				will work with. While our toddler workforce may work with images as physical photographs, computers work
				with images as 2D grids known as <strong>pixel arrays</strong>. A color image is commonly represented
				with 3 pixel arrays, storing the red, green, and blue color values for each pixel.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
				With edge detection, since we are only interested in the intensity of a given pixel, we want our images
				to be represented as <strong>grayscale intensities</strong>. The intensity of a pixel can be directly
				calculated from its red, green, and blue color values. This allows us to easily convert color images to
				grayscale before trying to detect any edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have introduced the problem of edge detection and established what kind of data we are going to
				process. In the next section, we will explore the underlying mechanism for detecting edges.
