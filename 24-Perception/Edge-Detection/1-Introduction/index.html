			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<br>

			<p>
				For many of us, it is easy to find both the objects in a picture and their boundaries.
				Humans are very good at identifying what something is and where it is given a clear line of
				sight, but what if we need to find the boundaries of objects in an enormously large number photos?
				While we could put a room full of toddlers with markers at work and tell them to outline the edges
				in a stack of photos, we can do better in both performance and morals by making a computer do this
				task
				for us! In fact, in computer vision, this is a general problem known as <strong>edge
					detection</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Formally, edge detection is the process of detecting the boundaries in an image that separate great
				changes in brightness or <strong>intensity</strong>. One of the reasons to do edge detection is that
				it is
				able to reduce a complex image down to a simpler one where only these edges are marked. Because of
				this,
				edge detection often acts as a preliminary step to other computer vision processes.

			<p>
				Before we dive into edge detection, we must talk about how an image is represented on a machine.
				While our toddler workforce may work with physical photographs, computers work with images as 2D
				grids known as <strong>pixel arrays</strong>. A color image, for instance, is commonly represented
				with 3 grids,
				storing the red, green, and blue color values at each pixel. With edge detection, since we are
				generally
				only interested in the intensity of a pixel, or how bright or dark it is, we will often first
				convert
				our color images to <strong>grayscale</strong> intensities which can be calculated from the
				red, green, and blue color values.
