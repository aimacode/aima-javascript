This contains a list of concepts that needs to be covered in the visualizations for the book.
Please Note :

* Multiple concepts can be covered by one visualization.
* Visualization for some concepts might not be necessary
* The concepts can be given priority and then sorted according to it so that we can complete high priority tasks first.

The task of implementing visualization and tools for the book has been divided into the following modules and submodules :

1. Introduction
2. Intelligent Agents
  1. Concept of Environment
  2. Concept of an Agent
  3. A table Driven Agent
  4. A simple reflex Agent
  5. A randomized Simple reflex Agent
  6. A model based reflex Agent
  7. A goal based Agent
  8. A utility based Agent
  9. A learning Agent
3. Solving Problems by Searching
  1. Defining a problem (Initial state, Goal test, Actions, Path-Cost etc)
  2. State Space Diagram
  3. Search Trees and Node expansion
  4. Tree Search and Graph Search
  5. Role of a Queue
