# aima-javascript
Visualization of concepts from Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence — A Modern Approach", and Javascript code for algorithms. Unlike aima-python, aima-java, and other sibling projects, this project is primarily about the visualizations and secondarily about the code.

Some Javascript visualizations that I admire, and would like to see similar kinds of things here:
